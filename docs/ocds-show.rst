=========

`OCDS Show <https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-show>`_ is a JavaScript application for embedding visualizations of OCDS data. The DRT generates data for OCDS Show in ``views.py`` so that it can be embedded in the ``explore_`` templates. Additional functions to help with the data generation for OCDS show are in ``cove_ocds/lib/ocds_show_extra.py``.
